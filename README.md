## Why

- As a front-end developer, everytime before I create a new project, I have to open a terminal, enter some commands recommended in the front-end framework documentation; sometimes I even forget these commands. This whole process apparently needs more efficiency.
- During the development of Flutter, I found that I could quickly create a Flutter project through the Dart extension for VSCode, so I developed this extension in order to do the same when creating some front-end projects.
