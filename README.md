## Why

- As a front-end developer, every time I create a new project, I always open a terminal, enter some commands recommended in the front-end framework documentation, enter or select something in the terminal, and finally get a new project. This whole process is a bit tedious for me, because I often forget these commands. During the development of Flutter, I found that I could quickly create a Flutter project through the Dart extension of VSCode, I was wondering if I could do the same when creating some front-end projects, so I developed this.
